### Honesty
We're never going to just tell you what you want to hear. We want to be truthful and make sure you know what you're getting into before making a trip to Colombia. You never have to be concerned that we would value making profit over keeping it real with you.

### Trustworthiness
When you come to Colombia, we want you to have a friend. We want you to see us as the guardian angel, and we won't take that lightly.

### Accountability
Whether you've scheduled a presentation session with us, travel consulting, 24/7 travel support, or spanish lessons, you will know we are 100% accountable, proffesional, and present. You won't have to wait on us for results, helping you is our main priority, we owe it to you.

### Customer Care
We understand just how important our services are to you and we want to handle that responsibility with care. We want your vacation to go off without a hitch and we want to guide you through the process from the time you plan to the time you get home and our commitment to you is to do this with care.
