      With Enjoy Safe Travels Colombia guidance, we were able to plan a trip ourselves to Colombia, but we had insider
      knowledge helping us make the right decisions.

      We took advantage of the 24/7 on-call support offered and although we only communicated a couple times about
      dinner recommendations, it was nice to know I had a friend here in Colombia ready and waiting ot help out if we needed it.
