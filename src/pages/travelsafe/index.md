         Colombia is a country you should visit, point blank. However, anyone who 
         has visited a foreign country (especially Colombia) wishes they would
         have had someone to tell them all the "do's" and "don't's". Let us help
         you avoid the biggest mistakes made by tourists, schedule your presentation 
         and we will help make your trip to Colombia effortless and more important than 
         everything else, SAFE!

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
