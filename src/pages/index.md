        Hablas Espanol? We find it incredibly important to have a complete, even
        if beginner, understanding of the Spanish language. On top of that,
        Colombian Spanish in particular is full of words and surprises you may
        not have learnt in your high school Spanish class. Schedule some Spanish
        sessions with us so you can stay in the driver's seat next time you're
        in Colombia!

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
