         Colombia is a country you should visit, point blank. However, anyone who 
         has visited a foreign country (especially Colombia) wishes they would
         have had someone to tell them all the "do's" and "don't's". Let us help
         you avoid the biggest mistakes made by tourists, schedule your presentation 
         and we will help make your trip to Colombia effortless and more important than 
         everything else, SAFE!

      I took Spanish in high school so I thought I would "be good" in Colombia. Once getting here
      I realized I was greatly mistaken. The classes I've taken with Enjoy Safe Travels Colombia
      have been a great service and have helped me enjoy Colombia and feel more engaged!

      I was concerned about my trip to Colombia so I took the 3 course curriculum and although I'm
      not fluent in Spanish, I feel more prepared for my trip.
