        Whether you enjoy a group setting or a 1 on 1 private lesson, we offer a 
        wide variety of Spanish lessons and content. We already know the Colombian slang
        and local vocabulary, let us help you learn exactly what you'll need to know. Applications like Duolingo
        can help with general learning but a more focused Colombian (Latin American) curriculum can help prepare you
        specifically for a Colombian adventure.

    Travelers are always surprised to find out just how little enligh is spoken in Colombia.
    You've never felt true hopelessness until you can't even order a hamburger in a burger restaurant 
    or a cup of coffee in a coffee shop. Immerse yourself in the culture and the local language and you 
    will find many layers to peel back that you'd never have found otherwise.

      I took Spanish in high school so I thought I would "be good" in Colombia. Once getting here
      I realized I was greatly mistaken. The classes I've taken with Enjoy Safe Travels Colombia
      have been a great service and have helped me enjoy Colombia and feel more engaged!

      I was concerned about my trip to Colombia so I took the 3 course curriculum and although I'm
      not fluent in Spanish, I feel more prepared for my trip.
